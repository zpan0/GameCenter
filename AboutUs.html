						Hello! <br>
						<br>
						I am Zi Li Pan. I am a senior at GSU majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Japanese. I enjoy playing games, 
						reading manga, and watching anime. I mostly spend my time doing one of those things. My favorite anime is One Piece.
						I don't have any favorite games or manga since they have much more impressive collection. I think my interest in these made 
						me decide to minor in Japanese. Hopefully, I'll hone my skills and one day work in Japan's tech industry. <br>
						<br>
						This project is a website in which users will be able to play all kinds of games, all in one place.
						I decided to choose this for my project because I really enjoy games and am also looking into game design in the future.
						I still find it difficult to code games using these new languages I've learned this semester. 
						However, this project has given me the opportunity to review all kinds of code for games and trying to understand them.
						Because of time constraints, I don't think I'll because to create my own game from scratch, however, I will be editing 
						the games provided here to make it optimal for your enjoyment! <br>
						<br>
						In this project I've used PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX, PhpMyAdmin (MySQL), JQuery, Foundation, and Three.js. PHP was used to 
						implement some functionalities, check cookies, and to connect to and to modify and query the database. HTML was used to create
						the webpages. CSS was used to design the pages. JS was used to add fuctionality, check cookies, and also to create the games. 
						AJAX was used to modify an query the database without needing to refreshing the webpage. MySQL is the database used. JQuery and 
						Foundation was used to make it easier to create and design the webpages. Three.js is a library used to create Crossy Road.<br>
						<br>
						I've learned a lot from this class and project. To start, this is my first time learning JS, CSS, PHP, and HTML. So, aside from
						the basics I've learned from class exercieses, everything was new for me. For example, creating more complex functions in JS and PHP, 
						using PHP and cookies to check different kinds of information from the user, more detailed web designing and using CSS, 
						etc... Mostly, I've been just testing a bunch of things to see if it works and if it doesn't, finding the errors and 
						searching for better ways to solve the problems. W3schools was a really great resource I've used for this project.<br>
						<br>
						I didn't use wordpress, although it was stated many times as the industry standard nowadays. I've built all of these pages
						from scratch, and resusing elements as I see fit. My AWS server kept failing me and I also think that building elements and 
						creating my own code gives me a clearer idea of what goes on behind the scenes. I felt that this has given me a great learning
						opportunity.
